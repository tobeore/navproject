        <p1 style=color:black>Over the years, the African continent has been going to various crisis. This has negativelly affected the lives of the children in Africa.</p1>
        <h3 style=color:maroon>THE AFRICAN CHILD SUFFRES FROM HUNGER</h3>
        <p1 style=color:black>It was estimated by the World Bank estimates that between 45 and 50 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa live on less than $ 1.25 a day. This makes the sub-Saharan region the poorest region in the world. The African continent also has the highest number of malnourished people, at 24.8 percent. 

            In Africa over 30 percent of children suffer from the consequences of chronic malnutrition: physical and mental development disorders affect their daily lives. They are often too small for their age, suffer from heart disease, kidney damage, and have a very weak immune system that is very difficult to ward off diarrhea or pneumonia.
            
        </p1>
       <h3 style=color:maroon>HIGH CHILD MORTALITY RATE</h3> 
<p1>Despite the millennium goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, one child in the world still dies every five seconds. The child mortality rate is particularly high in the African states of Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is the country with the highest infant mortality rate ever: out of 1,000 live births, 185 children do not experience their fifth birthday. The five most common causes of early death for many children in Africa include pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth.</p1>

<h3 style=color:maroon>GROW UP WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS</h3>
<p1>Growing up without a mother and father - that's the sad reality for 15 million children in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease HIV / AIDS has taken one or even both parents. They live with relatives or on the street, without a home. Many of the AIDS orphans were also infected with the treacherous virus while still in the womb or during birth or breastfeeding. 

A large number of AIDS orphans live in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Timely education and medication could significantly reduce the number of new infections in Africa.</p1>

 
<h3 style=color:maroon>EARLY MARRRIAGE AND CHILDREN SOILDIERS</h3>
<p1>Hunger, poverty, violence and armed conflicts mean that millions of African children are fleeing - alone or with their families. War is raging in many countries of the African continent: millions of children are living in constant terror in the midst of terror and violence. In countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad, Somalia, Uganda or Sudan child soldiers are still recruited.

<br>In the countries of western and northeastern Africa, girls are circumcised. Partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora is painful, life-threatening, and results in irreparable damage such as incontinence, infertility, or urinary tract infections. 

Infibulated girls and women feel strong pain during intercourse. Among the African countries where genital mutilation is widespread are Egypt, Somalia, Djibouti, Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone and the north of Sudan.

Millions of African girls are also threatened with forced marriages in many states. The marriage of underage girls is a tradition in many African tribes. Girls in childhood are married as a so-called "child brides" of their parents to a usually much older man and get far too early own children. Many others are forced to child labor.</p1>


<h3 style=color:maroon> WORK INSTEAD OF GOING TO SCHOOL</h3>
<p1>Primary education for all - this is the second of the UN Millennium Development Goals, which is unlikely to be achieved by 2015. Many children in Africa are excluded from school and contribute to the livelihood of their family instead. Experts estimate that a total of 30 million children in sub-Saharan Africa do not attend school. 54 percent of them are girls. 

Particularly critical is the situation in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Niger. Kids in Africa work on plantations, in mines, quarries or factories. Often they are forced to prostitute themselves. Most child laborers are exploited and have no chance of attending school because they have neither the time nor the strength to learn.</p1>
